##### ControlNet (from above (a) )(额外的插件)

Control Branch Structure

- Uses additional control branch (UNet encoder) to encode the conditioning
- Parameters independent from main model
- Initialized with zeros for better convergence and stability
- Control signals added throughout the network
	- They are integrated via skip connections that parallel the main UNet backbone
	- Each control block outputs features that are added to the corresponding UNet block
- zero-initialized convolutions
	The convolution layers in control blocks are initialized with zeros (weights = 0)
##### t2i-adapter

- Core Design
    - Lightweight structure
    - Only trains additional adapter module
    - Built with simple conv layers and **residual** blocks
    - Reduces parameter count significantly
- Integration Method
    - Control information added to every encoder layer input!!
	    Allows the encoder to process the conditioned information directly
    - Uses weight parameters to balance multiple adapters
    - Enables combined control during inference

(由于controlnet它使用了比较笨重的encoder作为control分支, 堆叠多个这样的encoder所带来的推理效率降低是非常显著的)

add conditioning on 跳跃链接
	
in unet , there is a jumping connection between encoder and its corresponding decoder, to reduce the loss of info by down sampling,使得decoder在解码的时候能够直接参考对应scale的encoder的信息
