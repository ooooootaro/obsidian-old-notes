And after Napoleon met his literal Waterloo and the monarchy was restored, Carnot’s father was sent into exile.

He published his research in a book called Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, in 1824.
Today it’s known as the Carnot engine, and the process by which it works is called the Carnot Cycle.

### cycle
The Carnot cycle consists of four processes, all of which are reversible – two adiabatic and two isothermal ones.
And it can take place in either a closed or a steady-state system.

As we start up our piston, the first process in the Carnot cycle is called reversible isothermal expansion.

That means that the temperature of the gas is basically kept constant throughout the process, which will continue until the piston reaches position 2.

Here, we’ll make the process adiabatic by replacing the reservoir with insulation. This means that as the gas expands, it can cool down, since it won’t be heated back up by the reservoir anymore.

some heat is transferred from the gas to the sink, which cools it down, causing the temperature to drop back down to TL.

This makes the Carnot cycle the most efficient cycle that we can have between two different temperatures.
His work shows us that the efficiency of a heat engine is only dependent on the temperatures of its heat reservoirs, rather than the types of fluids that it uses.

Diagnosed with “mania” and “general delirium,” he was then sent to an asylum, where he contracted cholera, which was sweeping through Paris at the time.
And because all of his personal belongings were considered to be contaminated, they were buried with him, including all of his notebooks and papers. So, the full scope of his work, and his genius, has been lost to history.
