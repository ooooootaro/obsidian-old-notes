Now, once a fluid is stressed, the degree to which it stretches is called strain. Simply put, strain is the deformation that stress causes on a system.

viscosity
Viscosity is essentially a measure of a fluid’s resistance to flow, and it’s often referred toas the thickness of a fluid.
	Some fluids will also thicken when exposed to stress, like when you whisk water mixed with cornstarch.
	But others will thin out when exposed to stress, like quicksand, which is just water mixed with lots of sand. 
While no real fluid is perfectly Newtonian, many fluids, like air and water, are close enough that we can think of them that way.

Osborne Reynolds
	In 1883, Reynolds conducted an experiment that revealed there are two main types of flow in a pipe: laminar层流的 and turbulent.

	Reynolds’ experiment allowed him to determine when the transition would occur from laminar to turbulent, giving us the quantity we now know as the Reynolds number.

	Now, the value we get for our Reynolds number will be dimensionless, meaning there are no units attached to it, but it can tell us a lot about the movement of a fluid.

	Inertial forces represent the driving kinetic movement of the fluid, which result in chaotic flow movement, like the swirling motion of eddies and vortices.
	Viscous forces represent resistance to flow and are more likely to provide slow, steady motion.  

	Therefore, a low Reynolds number represents laminar flow, while a high Reynolds number represents turbulent flow.
	In a pipe, laminar flows will usually have aReynolds number lower than 2100, while turbulentflows will usually be higher than 4000.


	The more resistance our cars have from theair, the harder it is to go faster and the more fuelthey’ll need to use to travel at a given speed.
	So remember, it’s not just the system that matters, but also the surroundings.

### Bernoulli's principle
that as the speed of fluid flowing horizontally increases, the pressure drop will decrease, and vice versa.
ONLY apply to isentropic flow
meaning it doesn’t involve any heat transfer, and it’s reversible, so it can go back to its initial state with no outside work.
Or at least, close enough that you can neglect the effects of heat transfer or irreversibility.
For Bernoulli’s Principle, the fluid also needs to flow horizontally, or not have a drastic change in height, because it doesn’t consider the effects of gravity.

Many engineers will take this equation a step further and divide the whole thing by gravity,

The pump also needs to be able to perform enough work to account for the pressure and velocity of the water, as well as any changes in elevation.

The world isn’t always perfect, but with the right engineering skills and tools, it doesn't have to be.
