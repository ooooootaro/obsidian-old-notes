## how to train a model

Collect a dataset of images and labels
Use Machine Learning algorithms to train a classifier
Evaluate the classifier on new images
	可泛化性


##### Hyperparameters: Something the machine can't learn itself
Very problem-dependent.
Must try them all out and see what works best.

Loss function: tells how good our current classifier
Regularization: Prevent the model from doing too well on training data
Optimization: Try to minimize the loss
Activation Function: Induce the non-linear property to the NN
