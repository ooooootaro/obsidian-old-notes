1940s to describe the kinetics of spins during magnetic fields (including B0 and B1!)

### RF duration is very short
we can ignore the T1 and T2 relaxation
then
1. In the rotating frame
2. all spins are on-resonant(alto impossible in reality)

##### Concept of flip angle

### Bloch equation after RF excitation
After RF excitation, the B1 is also turned off. 
Also, recall in the rotating frame, when spins are on-resonant, we do not consider the impact of B0.

Graphically, we have

**You will need to use these formula when you try to determine the steady-state signal in a sequence!**

###### Wait, you said there is T2* relaxation, right? Why is here only T2 relaxation? 
For T2* relaxation, note that the B0 field cannot be homogeneous. 
That means, in each voxel, magnetization have slightly different w0, and thus after a while, they  diphase. 

The apparent decay of magnitude in a voxel is the T2* relaxation.
