### Main
An echo is acquired after each 180 refocusing pulse. 
Each echo is used to build a different T2-weighted image.

A series of echoes are generated by using multiple 180o pulses.
Each echo reverses the effects of B0 inhomogeneity
The echoes become weaker due to T2 decay.

The multiple 180° pulses create different echo times, allowing collection of different T2-weighted contrasts efficiently in a single TR period. Each echo fills different k-space lines to form separate images.

#蛤 
- TR contains 4 different echoes (producing 4 contrasts)
- Ny is number of phase encoding steps
- Nex = 1 (single excitation)

The "4 contrasts" refers to what's produced within each TR period, not the value of T in the equation.
### FSE Fast Spin-Echo Pulse Sequence

###### From Claude
This is a Fast Spin-Echo (FSE) sequence showing:

1. Multiple 180° refocusing pulses after initial 90° pulse
2. Key timing parameters:
    - SE: Spin Echo spacing
    - ESP: Echo Spacing
    - ETL=4: Echo Train Length (4 echoes per excitation)
3. Gradient components:
    - SS: Slice Selection
    - PE: Phase Encoding (note different amplitudes for each echo)
    - FE: Frequency Encoding

The main difference from regular Spin-Echo is that FSE acquires multiple k-space lines per TR by using **different phase encodings for each echo** in the echo train, making it faster than conventional Spin-Echo.

##### PD weighting
FSE is an example of “segmenting” the acquisition into fewer “Tr’s” than k-space lines. Almost any sequence can be segmented if T2s are long enough.

##### T2 weighting

###### Claude
For FSE sequences, the key differences between T2 and PD weighting are:

T2 weighting:
- Long TR (>2000ms)
- Effective TE = Time to center of k-space (usually middle echo)
- Long effective TE (>80ms)

PD weighting:
- Long TR (>2000ms)  
- Effective TE = Time to center of k-space (usually first echo)
- Short effective TE (<30ms)

The main difference is when you acquire the center of k-space - early echoes for PD contrast, later echoes for T2 contrast. The TR remains long in both cases.
